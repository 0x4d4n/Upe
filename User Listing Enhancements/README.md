# Upe Shortcodes

## Useful shortcodes that can be used within a business listing. 

These shortcodes are currently in beta and new ones will be added tweaked and modified. If you have any issues let us know here or via u.pe  

If you would like to request a feature or shortcode let us know.

## WhatsApp

### Prerequisites 

The listing/business needs to have their WhatsApp number filled in.

### How to use

Simply put the shortcode on the listing where you want it to display a button to trigger a whatsapp message to the business with the pre-canned text below. 

#### For example if you would like an order button in the specials section add it like below:
